This repo contains a few simple scripts for understanding economic data and portfolio modeling. First, 
 a simple set of scripts on top of [fredr](https://github.com/sboysel/fredr) with plotting 
tools by [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2). Secondly, a set of portfolio modeling functions.

It's aim is to give a sense of the macroeconomy for macro-driven momentum trading strategies.

## To-Do

- Add German economic indicators. See https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html
- Complete portfolio modeling scripts for mininum variance portfolio + maximum Sharpe portfolio. Both 
require reasonable expected return vectors $\mu$.
